# valetservices

Summary:
The inspiration for my project stems from my recent experience with a startup company called Valet Living which provides professional valet services such as doorstep trash pickup, resident maintenance services, dry cleaning service, etc to the residents living in rental properties. The scope of my project limits to creating a customized app to a sample rental property that can support Valet Living services.

For example, let's say a rental property in Herndon, VA outsourced certain resident services to Valet Living and asked Valet Living to expose an app that can be used by its residents to pick a maintenance service as per a sample screenshot below (Maintenance Request leading to Valet Services App; Courtesy: Icon at Dulles, Herndon, VA). The app would essentially contain 2 pages where 1st page is dedicated to residents to pick and choose the services that they require for their apartment and 2nd page is dedicated to admin to add services that they desire to provide to the residents. Both pages would have user authentication module requesting user/admin to login before they go ahead with their requests on the app.
